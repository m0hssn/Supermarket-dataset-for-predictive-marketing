# Supermarket Dataset for Predictive Marketing
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use a supermarket dataset to perform predictive marketing using RFM analysis.

# What is RFM analysis?
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively which customers are the best ones by examining how recently a customer has purchased (recency), how often they purchase (frequency), and how much the customer spends (monetary). RFM analysis is based on the marketing axiom that “80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers.”
